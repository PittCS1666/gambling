## Game Description

School Sanctioned Gambling is a Texas Hold'em Poker Game. It has two modes: Online Multiplayer and Local Play. In Online Multiplayer, players can join a pool and play against other people online. In Local Play, players can face off against a robust AI system to hone their skills or have fun offline.

## Advanced Topic Description

### Advanced AI

There are two difficulties of AI in the game: Easy and Hard. Easy difficulty uses a combination of randomness and basic decision tree logic to decide what moves to make, and is ideal for newer players. Hard difficulty uses Counterfactual Risk Management so the AI will decide the optimal move based on current cards held and shown as the game progresses.
 
### Online Multiplayer

The game will use a custom dedicated server to manage online multiplayer networking needs. We use a lobby-based system, where players can create and join lobbies to play against each other. Players can create unique lobby codes to play against friends in pools of 2 to 6 people.

## Midterm Goals

* Working start screen and menu
* Get simple messages going back and forth over the server using some approved external framework
* Playing a whole game against a single easy AI (with AI cards shown)

## Final Goals

* 35%: Local play with both AI difficulty options
* 10%: Saving and loading local games
* 35%: Fully functional online multiplayer games (2-6 players)

## Stretch Goals

* AI improvements: More intelligent AI bluffing and comparison to cheating/card counting AI
* Multiplayer login functionality for leaderboards (wins, losses, and chips won)
